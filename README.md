if condition:
    # Code block if condition is True
else:
    # Code block if condition is False

 How It Works:
sum = 0 initializes the total to zero.

for i in range(1, 51): loops from 1 to 50 (inclusive).

Inside the loop, each number is added to sum.

After the loop ends, it prints the final result.
